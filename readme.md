# Simple Sales Flow connected to an Woocommerce Store

### What was the plan:

<!-- The plan was building some kind of web app hat would consume an woocommerce exposed REST API as much as I can to learn the ins and outs of whatâ€™s possible with that API. -->

### What di I have to do:

<!-- Had to learn about the Ionic framework and Angular and build the primary features of an e-ecommerce store using data from another website built with wordpress and woocommerce. -->

### What was the cool part:

<!-- The cool part was seeing the app get some shape and the products, customers and orders coming from the external website. -->
